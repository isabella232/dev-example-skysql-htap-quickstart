# MariaDB SkySQL HTAP Quick Start

[MariaDB SkySQL](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/) is the best database-as-a-service (DBaaS) available today. Itâ€™s the first DBaaS to support OLTP, OLAP and hybrid workloads, storing data both in row format on persistent block storage and columnar format on object storage. 

**The following is a walkthrough to get you up and running with a MariaDB SkySQL [Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://mariadb.com/docs/solutions/htap/) database instance in less than 15 minutes.** No, seriously. Alright, let's get started!

And, if you haven't yet - [sign up for MariaDB SkySQL](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/get-started/). We're currently offering $500 credit which is a lot of runway depending on how you set up your instances. TL;DR it's free for developers wanting to check it out.

## Prerequisites 

Before getting started with this walkthrough you will need to:

1. [Install the latest, stable MariaDB client](https://downloads.mariadb.org/).

2. [Launch a SkySQL Smart Transaction (HTAP) instance](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/operations/provision/#skysql-launch-smart).

3. Clone this repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhedgpeth/skysql_htap_demo.git
```

## Overview

This walk-through will investigate the following:

* Setting up an existing database instance
    * Connect to your MariaDB SkySQL HTAP instance
    * Create the schema and load the tables
    * Enable replication
* Introduction to cross-engine querying
* Testing table-to-table replication

## Set up the database instance

The following steps will 

1. Download the HTAP instance's Certificate authority chain from SkySQL, and place in the root of this project.

    </kbd>
</p>

2. Execute the following command with your database instance information.

```
$ ./create_and_load.sh <host_address> <port_number> <user> <password>
```

for example

```
./create_and_load.sh sky0001355.mdb0001390.db.skysql.net 5001 DB00009999 *******
```

For more information on loading data into SkySQL databases be sure to check out the [official documentation](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/operations/data-loading/)!

3.) Execute the following command on your MariaDB SkySQL database instance to set up replication.

```
SELECT SET_HTAP_REPLICATION('flights','travel','travel_history');
```

That's it! The following will be created, loaded, and configured to replicate (travel.flights -> travel_history.flights).

- [travel](schema/idb_schema.sql#L1) (database)
    - [airlines](schema/idb_schema.sql#L5) (InnoDB table): 17 rows
    - [airports](schema/idb_schema.sql#L11) (InnoDB table): 342
    - [flights](schema/idb_schema.sql#L21) (InnoDB table): 0 rows
- [travel_history](schema/cs_schema.sql#L1) (database)
    - [flights](schema/cs_schema.sql#L5) (ColumnStore table): 679996 rows

## The Power of HTAP

### Introduction to cross-engine querying

Cross-engine querying, or joining, allows you to query both transactional and analytical information in a single query. Execute the following sample queries to get a first-hand view of the power of cross-engine querying.

**Get the number of flights for each airline**

```sql
SELECT 
    a.airport,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    travel.airlines a INNER JOIN
    travel_history.flights f ON a.iata_code = f.carrier
GROUP BY
    a.airline
```

**Get the top ten airports with the lowest average departure delays**

```sql
SELECT 
    a.airport, 
    AVG(dep_delay) 
FROM 
    travel.airports a INNER JOIN 
travel_history.flights f ON a.iata_code = f.origin 
GROUP BY
    a.airport 
ORDER BY
    AVG(dep_delay) 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Testing table-to-table replication

When using MariaDB Platform for Smart Transactions, data can be replicated from InnoDB tables to ColumnStore tables, which we've already enabled. So, let's test it out!

1. Insert a new flight record into `travel.flights`.

```sql
INSERT INTO travel.flights VALUES(2020,4,3,1,'2020-04-03','DL','N9999A',100,'ORD','LAX','0600','0600',0);
```

2. Confirm that the record has been inserted `travel.flights` and replicated to `travel_history.flights` by comparing the following results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM travel.flights WHERE fl_date = '2020-04-03' AND tail_num = 'N9999A';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM travel_history.flights WHERE fl_date = '2020-04-03' AND tail_num = 'N9999A';
```
